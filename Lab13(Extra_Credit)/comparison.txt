Bubble
Best Case Comparisons and Swaps:  O(n)
Worst Case Comparisons and Swaps: O(n^2)
Memory Complexity O(1)
Step Graph:
The bubble sort step graph shows the number of steps greatly rising as the set gets larger and levels out
Time Graph:
Time is constant no matter the size
Space Graph:
Constant space is needed no matter the size

Insertion
Best Case Comparisons and Swaps:  O(n)
Worst Case Comparisons and Swaps: O(n^2)
Memory Complexity O(1)
Step Graph:
The insert sort step graph shows the number of steps rising as the set gets larger
but levels out
Time Graph:
Time is constant no matter the size
Space Graph:
Constant space is needed no matter the size

Merge
Best Case Time Complexity O(nlogn)
Worst Case Time Complexity O(nlogn)
Memory Complexity O(n)
Step Graph:
The bubble sort step graph shows the number of steps gently rising as the set gets larger and levls out
Time Graph:
Time is constant no matter the size
Space Graph:
Constant space is needed no matter the size, but is more than the space needed for the other sorts

For a constant set size and variable maximum:
Merge sort is the best for larger list, bubble is the worst for large list, and insertion falls in the middle.
